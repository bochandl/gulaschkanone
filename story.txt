I woke up today with my Hund laying on top of me in my bed.
I baked a gebaeck and went about my day.
After that, I decided to relax in my schloss for a few hours.
I modeled it after the Eltz, and I and my hund are quite proud of it.
My hund decided that he would like to go to the park, so we hopped into my bright red Porsche.
I turned on the klimaanlage as I drove down hauptstrasse.
I made my way to Lederhose, to visit my good friend Mehlhase.
Melhase owns a baeckerei, so I hope to have some delicious treats when I get to him.
John wanted to impress his date by baking her an Apfelkuchen. He accidentally use salt instead of sugar. I don't know what to call it but he made a mess.
