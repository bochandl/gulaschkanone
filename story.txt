I woke up today with my Hund laying on top of me in my bed.
I baked a gebaeck and went about my day.
After that, I decided to relax in my schloss for a few hours.
I modeled it after the Eltz, and I and my hund are quite proud of it.
My hund decided that he would like to go to the park, so we hopped into my bright red Porsche.
